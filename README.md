# Dev Container Features (for R)

This repository contains a _collection_ of Dev Container Features.

For a detailed explanation of Dev Container Features,
please check [the specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/) and

This repository is based on the [the `devcontainers/features` repository](https://github.com/devcontainers/features),
and intended to make it easy to add R-related functionality on top of the Debian base containers.

## Contents
